This is a simple client/service application in Java 

Basic function
   - the server fetches a text file from disk
   - the server sends the file to client up on request
   - the client displays the file
   - the client displays the top 10 words in the file up on request

How to compile and run
==================================

The best way to compile and run would be to import the project in to Netbean or Eclipse IDE
and run it from there. 

I have already included client.jar and server.jar files in Executables folder which 
is in the main project (ClientServer) folder.


Steps to compile and run the project

1. Download the project to your computer

2. Extract and import the project to Eclipse or NetBeans IDE

3. Run the Server

4. Run the Client  
   
5. In the client GUI opened click on getFile button 

	- you will see the text file sent from the Server on the GUI

6. Then click the getTop10 button
	
	- you will see the top 10 words in the file with their frequency of occurrence
	

Thanks!
