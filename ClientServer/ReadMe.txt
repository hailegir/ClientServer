I have written a simple client/service application in Java 


How to compile and run
==================================

The best way to compile and run would be to import the project in to Netbean or Eclipse IDE
and run it from there. 

I have already included client.jar and server.jar files in Executable Files folder which 
is in the main project folder.

NB:  The jar files in the project folder are generated by eclipse export function.


Steps to compile and run the project

1. Download the project to your computer

2. import it to Eclipse or NetBeans IDE

3. Run the Server

4. Run the Client  
   
5. In the client GUI opened click on getFile button 

	- you will see the text file sent from the Server on the GUI

6. Then click the getTop10 button
	
	- you will see the top 10 words in the file with their frequency of occurrence
	

Thanks!
